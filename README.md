# Data Analyst Portfolio Project - Bike Share Data

This repository contains my full solution for the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program.

This project involved an analysis on bike share data for a fictional company in Chicago called Cyclistic.

The data was provided from this link: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html where I downloaded the bike share data from December 2020 through November 2021

The Bike_Share_Data_Cleaning_Changelog.docx file shows the steps I took to clean the data.

See the Bike_Share_Portfolio_Project_Queries.sql file for all of the SQL queries I wrote to analyze the data.

Lastly, I put a Word document containing the project outline and my conclusions from my analysis of the data.
